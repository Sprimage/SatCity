# About Sat City

Sat City is a next-generation, text-based MMORPG that lives entirely on the Alkanes Bitcoin metaprotocol.
Inspired by Torn's open ended grit, Sat City drapes the classic liberties and commerce sandbox in pure cypher punk cloth:

    Bitcoin Native Economy - Every dollar you hustle is an on-chain alkanes token CipherChip(CHIP); every gun, microchip or forged passport is an Orbital you truly own. Earn it, trade it, stake it, cash it out—no fictional currency, no admin console printing money behind the curtain.

    Player-Run Government - Sat City replaces “game mods” with a constitutional DAO. Citizens elect a Congress of faction bosses, a Cabinet that sets tax rates and hospital fees, and a VRF-drawn Chain Court that burns crooked officials" bonds. Every new law hits the blockchain with a seven-day timelock, so corruption is spotted before it sticks.

    On‑Chain Communities as Factions – Any Bitcoin‑based club—an Ordinals collection, an Alkanes token DAO, or your own multisig crew—can mint a Faction NFT and claim turf. Bring your community on‑chain, rally around a shared treasury, and wage economic or literal war for control of Sat City’s districts.

    Cypher-punk Ethos - Zero custodial log-ins. Your Bitcoin key is your identity; sign once and prowl the city gas-free under a delegated session key. Nightly Merkle snapshots are pinned on-chain so anyone can audit the ledger and blow the whistle on tampering.

    Endless Possibilities - Run shipments, corner the neon-futures market, bribe miners to front-run a vault raid, or bankroll a guerrilla newspaper that leaks DAO scandals. All the classic gameplay loops—crimes, PvP ambushes, property empires—re‑tooled for hard‑money stakes and permissionless trade.

    Linear, Sustainable Growth – Adaptive sink‑and‑faucet curves keep CHIP's purchasing power stable while a pay‑master hedges backend costs in BTC. The city thrives whether bitcoin moons or dives.

In Sat City everyone is both hustler and stakeholder—building a shadow‑market metropolis whose rules, money and history are stamped forever into Bitcoin’s blocks. Welcome to the city that the chain can’t censor and the devs can’t secretly control.
